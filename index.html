         <p>My name is Rusty Libby. I live in Albuquerque with my partner and our four children.</p>
         <p>I am completely new to coding, but I am very excited to see what I learn in the fullstack bootcamp</p>
         <p>For the last nine years I was an operations manager at a pet crematorium called Lasting Paws.</p>
         <p>I hope that in the future I can use what I learned in bootcamp, and become a developer for the same company.</p>
