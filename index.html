         <p>My name is Rusty Libby. I live in Albuquerque with my partner and our four children. My family is the most important thing to me, </p>
         <p>I am completely new to coding, but I am very excited to see what I learn in the fullstack bootcamp. I am extra excited for this new phase in my life.</p>
         <p>For the last nine years I was an operations manager at a pet crematorium called Lasting Paws. I loved my job because you really are providing a service for people.</p>
         <p>I hope that in the future I can use what I learned in bootcamp, and become a developer for parent company of Lasting paws called Gateway.</p>
